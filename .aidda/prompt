test complex section structure

Add a test case that randomly generates an input document with a
complex section structure. Use a seed of 1 to ensure the same
structure is generated each time. The test case should:

- Generate a document structure with at least 10 sections, each with
  at least 10 subsections, with nesting ranging up to 5 levels deep,
  and with higher-level sections mixed in with lower-level sections
  in a random order.
- Run the resulting document through passMkHeads and check that the
  output contains the correct section numbering in anchor names and
  heading titles.
