fix passMkHeads

Compare testdata/sections-in.md and testdata/sections-out.md. The
testdata/sections-out.md file is the expected output of the passMkHeads
function when run with the testdata/sections-in.md file as input. 

Fix the passMkHeads function in main.go so that it produces the expected
output.
