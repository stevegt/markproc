fix passMkHeads handling of depth gaps

Compare testdata/sections-in.md and testdata/sections-out.md. The
testdata/sections-out.md file is the expected output of the passMkHeads
function when run with the testdata/sections-in.md file as input. 

Fix the passMkHeads function in main.go so that it properly handles
the case where there may be a gap in the depth of the headings in the
input. An example of this can be found in sections 4.* of the
testdata/sections-in.md file, and the corresponding output in the
testdata/sections-out.md file.
