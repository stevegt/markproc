test complex section structure

Refactor TestComplexSectionStructure to use hardcoded input and
expected files in testdata/.  The test case should use an input
document structure with at least 10 sections, each with at least 10
subsections, with nesting ranging up to 5 levels deep, and with
higher-level sections mixed in with lower-level sections in a random
order.

Each section title should be e.g "Section 1.3.2".
