refactor to use section numbers

We want to make a distinction between external references and internal
references. External references are to be named, while internal references
are to be numbered. 

- This helps to ensure that we don't accidentally refer to an internal
  section when we mean to refer to an external reference or vise
  versa.
- It also enables the reader to quickly identify whether a reference is
  to an internal section or an external document.

External references still use acronyms and still look like [this].

Internal references now use the acronyms in input e.g. [sec foo] but
output looks like [sec 1.5.3].  The anchor name for this example would
be sec1_5_3.

In the process of converting the file, insert section numbers into the
text of each heading. 

Get rid of dochash -- use e.g. sec1_5_3 as the anchor name for headings
