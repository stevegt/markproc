refactor passLinkHeads to iterate over lines 

Refactor the passLinkHeads function to iterate over the lines of the
input string instead o references.

- create a list of lowercased section names and anchor names to use in
  fuzzy matching
- for each line that matches '\[sec\s+([^\]]+)\]', extract the acronym
  and fuzzy-match it against the section names
- if exactly one insertion-only match is found, replace the acronym in
  the line with the section anchor name
